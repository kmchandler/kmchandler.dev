                        <div class="col-inner">
                          <p>I graduated from Nashville Software School in March of 2023, into what I can only describe as the Great Tech Depression. There are numerous reasons for this, including the rise of AI in coding, the surge of development jobs being outsourced overseas, economic downturns, political turmoil, and a myriad of other factors. In short, there are way more unemployed engineers than available jobs, and many more developers in the pipeline.</p>

                          <p>This is unfortunate. It’s also reality, and it’s what many developers, both new and old, find themselves up against. This is an excellent example of a time to practice what DBT therapy refers to as radical acceptance.  The majority of students who graduated with my cohort, myself included, have so far been unable to find full-time employment in the tech industry. But we’re still trying. We’re networking, applying for jobs, working on apps, making portfolio sites, and writing blog posts (how meta). If you’re thinking of going into software development, you are probably wondering if I would try to dissuade you, or if I regret pursuing this career path.</p>

                          <p>Absolutely not.</p>

                          <p>If you are casually interested in tech and want to learn more about it, I’d suggest taking some online classes and calling it a day. If you have something else you’d be interested in pursuing, I would certainly suggest going with another option. But there wasn’t another option for me. I have a degree in Marketing, and have worked in and around that field since graduating from Texas A&M with my undergrad in May of 2011. I was not a fan. I’ve never been passionate about Marketing or any other facet of business. But development? That’s my jam.</p>

                          <p>I love being part of the development and creation of the future. I love diving into code, entering a flow state, and losing myself to it. I love that you never have the same day twice, and so much of your time is spent being faced with new problems and implementing creative solutions. I love the people who are in this industry, and the friends I’ve made because of it. So I’m not going anywhere. Except forward.</p>

                          <p>For those of you who haven’t been scared off, I can only assume it’s because you, too, have a passion for technology and a deep love of the development process. So, what advice would I give to a new developer? There were several big things I learned, both in and after school, about how to approach development. Every person is different and therefore possesses different skills and challenges. But some of the things I experienced were as follows: </p>

                          <ul>

                            <li><b>Do one thing at a time.</b> No, seriously. Do one thing. Write one piece of code. Then test it. Does it run? Awesome! Now you can do one more thing. One more piece of code. Does everything still work? Yay! Time to write another function. Did something break? Yeah…that happens. No worries! You tested your code before this function, so you know exactly where the error is. See how easy that makes things?</li>

                            <li><b>Utilize debugging tools.</b> Learn how to use your dev tools in your browser. Figure out how to set break points and step through your code line by line to find the place where it stops working. Use the debugger feature in your text editor (I favor VS Code, but there are tons of different options).</li>

                            <li><b>Find a rubber duck.</b> In development, “rubber ducking” is the process of debugging code by explaining the issue, out loud, to a friend or an inanimate object. It comes from the book “The Pragmatic Programmer” by Andrew Hunt and David Thomas. In the book, the programmer carries around a literal rubber duck (yes, like the bath toy) and talks through their code, line by line, to the duck. It sounds weird, but it helps! When you explain a problem to another person (or plastic bath toy) you will often stumble across the solution. Sometimes it’s as simple as a typo; other times it may stem from viewing the problem in a different way. You can ask a friend (even one who doesn’t know a thing about development) or co-worker to rubber duck with you. Most people in tech will know what that means. But the easiest approach (and best first line of defense) is to keep a ducky on your desk; I have several. </li>

                            <li><b>Take breaks- early and often. </b> You may have noticed earlier when I mentioned I get lost in the code. That can be a good and bad thing. It’s important to timebox problems. After a while, you will often reach a point where it’s time to ask for help. Even if you aren’t stuck, setting a timer to go off every 60-90 minutes is a great idea; step away from the computer, use the restroom, have a snack and a stretch break, and clear your head. When you return to your computer, you will generally find yourself refreshed and ready to get to it. If you’re majorly stuck and massively frustrated? You definitely need a break. Trust me, it helps. </li>

                            <li><b>Code something you’re interested in.</b> Feeling stuck in your code, or uninspired? At a job, that happens. But there are so many new problems to solve and coding techniques and languages to learn that it doesn't stay that way for too long. But if you’re working on personal projects and you aren’t getting anywhere, I would suggest coding up something that interests you. My first capstone at school was a randomizer to help you select what to watch based on the mood you’re in. My current project is a baby tracking app for my little girl. It makes it easier to keep going when you get stuck or frustrated. That’s something I know from experience.</li>

                          </ul>

                          <p>There are many developers out there who are more experienced and skilled than I am. They can give you more tips and tricks, and I’m sure they have lots of excellent advice. I certainly recommend seeking them out, online or in person. But if you are looking for some basic advice for new developers, I hope you found this helpful or, at the very least, entertaining. </p>

                          <p>Coding can be difficult. And wonderful. And frustrating. And a lot of fun. And if you’re lucky enough to find yourself employed in this fascinating field (as I hope to be soon), I would say you’re very, very lucky.</p>
